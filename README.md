# No Boundaries

No Boundaries provide sessions using various cricket and exercise based activities to promote and improve a childâ€™s physical, mental and social wellbeing. By encouraging and increasing these three areas of wellbeing, a child has the best chance to thrive in all areas of their future lives.

This project will be creating a new website for No Boundaries to use when introducing themselves to schools and councils, in the hope of securing bookings. 
 
## UX
 
This website will be used by teachers, councils and parents. The main aim of the website will be to introduce the business and show what they do, as well as tell them some information about the team. This will be in the hope of securing the booking of sessions for the teachers school, or saturday sessions through the council. The website may also be used as a means of contact between user and staff. 

Due to the mix of people using the website, the visual language will need to have a balanced look between professional, for the teachers, and playful, to show the parents that it will be a fun program for their children to take part in. 

### User Stories

-   I am a Headteacher of a primary school. I have secured some funding to use towards an afterschool activity for the pupils of my school. 

    A lot of the children are already members of Saturday football teams, so I would like an alternitive to football. However, there should also be a focus on helping the pupils thrive as people, rather than just sport coaching.

    The website will show that the sessions focus on the social and mental wellbeing of the pupils, as well as the physical wellbeing. I will also point out some key facts about childrens well being, such as obesity levels and despression / anxiety figures in young children. The website will have an introduction to the staff so the teachers can get more familiar with who they are going to be working with. There will also be a contact page where teachers can get in touch should they require more information or a meeting. 


-   I am the Leisure and Culture officer at the local council. I am looking for activities to put on in the community to engage children with     socialising and becoming more active.

    I would like to put on some Saturday sessions which will help young children in my community make new friends as well as getting children physically fitter in the aim of reducing child obesity. Due to the rise in the interest of cricket in England, since the victory in the cricket world cup last year, this will be good activity to invest in.

    Again, the website will show key stats with childrens health, which will hopefully match the concerns of the counciller to engage an initial connection. Focusing on the three main aims of the business, social - mental and physical wellbeing of children. The website will need to point out that the team are focused in the London and Surrey area.
  

-   I am the parent of a pupil in primary school.

    My daughter is shy, and struggles to socialise with other children and I am concerned about her confidence which may be detramental in the future. I am looking at after school / weekend clubs which she will be able to participate in which will not be too aggresive or full on, as we have found some team sports to be overwhelming. 

    Cricket can be known as 'the gentlemans game' - not in the sense that only men should play, but that it is not aggresive, violent or nasty as other sports. I would need to show this through the visual language, by using soft colors, friendly fonts, and rounded edges. The content should make the user feel confident that their children are in safe hands. An introduction to the team will do this, as well as showing a focus on adapting social skills. 
 


This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Features

Homepage - A brief introduction to the business and some key stats to encourage people to invest in the page.

What We do - This will be a more detailed introduction to the business and the core values.

Meet The Team - A page to show visitors to the site the members of No Boundaries, with some information about them.

Contact - A contact form so people wishing to speak to the team have a way to do so.

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

## Technologies Used

HTML5

CSS

[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
    - This project will use **Bootstrap** as a framework. The main use of this will be for the layout and grid of the page.

[Google-Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
    - I will be using a range of fonts from Google to make the page more visually appealing.

[Fontawsome](https://fontawesome.com/)
    - I will use Fontawsome for the pictograms on my site.

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.

1 - Navbar code taken from [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/navs/#horizontal-alignment)
    - This was used to create the menu options which are aligned to the right.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
