# No Boundaries

This is my first milestone project towards my full-stack developer course with the Code Insitute. I have created a website for a new business called no boundaries. They are a new business and already have a basic wordpress website, so this project came at a good time to benefit both parties.

No Boundaries provide sessions using various cricket and exercise based activities to promote and improve a childâ€™s physical, mental and social wellbeing. By encouraging and increasing these three areas of wellbeing, a child has the best chance to thrive in all areas of their future lives.

This project will be creating a new website for No Boundaries to use when introducing themselves to schools and councils, in the hope of securing bookings. 
 
## UX
 
This website will be used by teachers, councils and parents. The main aim of the website will be to introduce the business and show what they do, as well as tell them some information about the team. This will be in the hope of securing the booking of sessions for the teachers school, or saturday sessions through the council. The website may also be used as a means of contact between user and staff. 

Due to the mix of people using the website, the visual language will need to have a balanced look between professional - for the teachers, and playful - to show the parents that it will be a fun program for their children to take part in. I will hope to achive this by having the website look clean and sharp with bright colors. 

### User Stories

-   I am a Headteacher of a primary school. I have secured some funding to use towards an afterschool activity for the pupils of my school. 

    A lot of the children are already members of Saturday football teams, so I would like an alternitive to football. However, there should also be a focus on helping the pupils thrive as people, rather than just sport coaching.

    The website will show that the sessions focus on the social and mental wellbeing of the pupils, as well as the physical wellbeing. I will also point out some key facts about childrens well being, such as obesity levels and despression / anxiety figures in young children. The website will have an introduction to the staff so the teachers can get more familiar with who they are going to be working with. There will also be a contact page where teachers can get in touch should they require more information or a meeting. 


-   I am the Leisure and Culture officer at the local council. I am looking for activities to put on in the community to engage children with     socialising and becoming more active.

    I would like to put on some Saturday sessions which will help young children in my community make new friends as well as getting children physically fitter in the aim of reducing child obesity. Due to the rise in the interest of cricket in England, since the victory in the cricket world cup last year, this will be good activity to invest in.

    Again, the website will show key stats with childrens health, which will hopefully match the concerns of the counciller to engage an initial connection. Focusing on the three main aims of the business, social - mental and physical wellbeing of children. The website will need to point out that the team are focused in the London and Surrey area.
  

-   I am the parent of a pupil in primary school.

    My daughter is shy, and struggles to socialise with other children and I am concerned about her confidence which may be detramental in the future. I am looking at after school / weekend clubs which she will be able to participate in which will not be too aggresive or full on, as we have found some team sports to be overwhelming. 

    Cricket can be known as 'the gentlemans game' - not in the sense that only men should play, but that it is not as aggresive, violent or nasty as other sports. I would need to show this through the visual language, by using soft colors, friendly fonts, and rounded edges. The content should make the user feel confident that their children are in safe hands. An introduction to the team will do this, as well as showing a focus on adapting social skills. 
 


I did not use any mock-ups for this project. However, one reflection, I feel this was a mistake, and added wasted time to the project. I will be making mockups in the future.

## Features

-   Homepage - A brief introduction to the business and some key stats to encourage people to invest in the page.

-   What We do - This will be a more detailed introduction to the business and the core values.

-   Meet The Team - A page to show visitors to the site the members of No Boundaries, with some information about them.

-   The Facts - Some facts on childrens mental health and obesity issues in the UK.

-   Contact - A contact form so people wishing to speak to the team have a way to get in touch. 

### Fonts

I have used the Google Fonts library to make the text on my page visually appealing.

@import url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Luckiest+Guy&family=Raleway:wght@400;700;900&display=swap");

-   Luckiest Guy - This font was used as it is playful and similar to the existing logo used by the company. I was not entirely happy with how the existing logo worked on the page, as they did not have a high quality version of the logo. So I created one which is very simiar to achieve a more professional look for my project.

-   Raleway - I selected this font to use throughout the site as it works well as both a heading in bold and in normal weight for other text. It looks professional, friendly and is easy to read against the block colors of the background.

### color

I used Adobe Color to select the scheme for the website. The main color to be used was both the bright blue and grey. So I looked through the palettes to find one which features these two colors, but which also had a red to tie in to the cricket theme.

  color: #3c3d40
  color: #43aed9
  color: #f2f2f2
  color: #f26052
  color: #d95252

### Images

  The stock images used throughout the site were taken from the existing No Boundaries website. These are free to use images originally taken from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/)

  The images of the members of the team were sent to me by one of the directors of No Boundaries.
 
### Future Features
- In the future, I would wish to add more photos of the team in action to replace the stock images on the about us page.

- I would also like to add a booking system onto the site. This would be a page where people could log in and see the sessions they currently have booked, as well as the ability to book new sessions.

- I would also make the contact form fully functional so that people will actually be able to get in touch with the team.

- I have used a color scheme that is loosely based on the companies existing branding (a lot of use of bright light blue), with the use of some additional colors. In the future, should the website go on to be used by the company, I would accomodate any changes they wish to make to fit more with their own brand. 

- Similarly, I used a logo which is only based on the actual existing logo. This was because the existing image I had for the logo didn't appear as sharp as making a text based logo. I kept the playful font, however added a more subtle red to fit in with the color scheme I chose. I would change this to add in the actual logo once handing over to the business.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5 - This was used to create the structure of the site.

- CSS - This was used to make the page more visually appealing.

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
    - This project used **Bootstrap** as a framework. The main use of this will be for the layout and grid of the page.

- [Google-Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
    - I have used range of fonts from Google to make the page more visually appealing.

- [Fontawsome](https://fontawesome.com/)
    - I will have used FontAwesome for the pictograms on my site.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** for the mobile menu in the navbar.

- GitPod - This was used to create the HTML and CSS for the site.

- GitHub - This was used for hosting and version control of the website.


In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.

### Acknowledgements

- I received inspiration for this project from my old housemate at University. He has recently started up the 'o Boundaries' business and looking to make a living from this. Starting my course has come at a good time for both of us, as it gave me the opprtunity to base my project on something real, that may make a difference in the real world. It also gives the business the chance to have a bespoke website built for them for free.
